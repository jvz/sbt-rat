== Usage

This plugin is built for sbt 0.13.x and 1.x, and it is available as an auto plugin.
To add this to your project, add the following to your build:

.project/plugins.sbt
[source,scala]
----
addSbtPlugin("org.musigma" % "sbt-rat" % "0.5")
----

This adds two tasks: `auditCheck` and `auditReport`.
The first task will fail the build if the audit check fails.
The second task generates the audit report files (plain text and AsciiDoc).

=== Testing

Run `sbt "^scripted"` for http://www.scala-sbt.org/1.x/docs/Testing-sbt-plugins.html[sbt script tests].
